    Generate four unique multiple-choice technical questions commonly asked in interviews. 
    take help from geeks for geeks,interviewbit,leetcode, and other interview preparation sites.
    The questions should be related to one of the following topics: DBMS, OS, DSA, React, JavaScript, 
    C, C++, Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, Networking, Software Engineering (medium level). 
    Return a **valid JSON** object only with the following structure for each question:
    Generate a challenging multiple-choice quiz question for advanced MERN stack developers.
    Instructions:
    - The question should focus on advanced DBMS, OS, DSA, React, JavaScript, 
    C, C++, Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, Networking, Software Engineering topics.
    - Provide 4 distinct options, each not exceeding 100 characters.
    - Specify the correct answer by its index (0-based).
    - Include a brief explanation (up to 200 characters) of the correct answer.
    - Vary topics across different areas of Ruby and Rails, avoiding repetition of subjects like Lambda and Proc.

      Example:
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of `useEffect` hook in React?",
      "options": [
        "Execute code after render",

      "correct_option_id": 0,
      "explanation": "`useEffect` runs side effects in function components, often for tasks like fetching data or subscribing to events after the component renders."
